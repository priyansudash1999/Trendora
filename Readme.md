# Frontend

## Packages:-

### react-router-dom :-

- React Router DOM enables navigation between components in a React app without reloading the page.
- Without react-router-dom, navigating between pages in a React app would require :- Manual state handling for page views, or Full page reloads using a tag

### react-toastify :-

- react-toastify shows customizable toast notifications in a React app with a simple one-line function
- Example:- `toast("Message")`;

### tailwind css :-

- For styling

## Why I use it ?

### BrowserRouter:-

- `Import {BrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom"`
- BrowserRouter keeps the UI in sync with the URL using the browser's address bar.
- Without BrowserRouter Routing features like <Route>, <Link>, and navigation won't work.

### CreateContext :-

#### Why `<ShopContextProvider>` is important in main.jsx after install useContext ?
